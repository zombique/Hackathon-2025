This script cleans up all GCP resources related to the ML pipeline:
1. Deletes Cloud Functions (train-model, predict-transaction, suspicious-transactions).
2. Deletes GCS Buckets (train & predict).
3. Deletes BigQuery dataset (transactions_dataset).

Run this manually in Cloud Shell or locally with authenticated gcloud SDK.
